## *Digit-Recognition*

*This notebook is a basic example of how to perform digit recognition using the 'load_digits' dataset from 'sklearn.datasets'. The dataset contains 1797 images of hand-written digits, with each image being an 8x8 pixel array.*


### *Results*

*After running the notebook, you should see the accuracy of the model printed to the console. For me, the model achieves an accuracy of around 99%.
Feel free to experiment with different models and hyperparameters to see if you can improve the accuracy.*
